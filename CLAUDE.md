# Moonshot Agent Rules

These rules are mandatory for all implementation work in this repository.

## 0) Package Manager Standard
- Use `uv` for all Python dependency and environment management.
- Do not use `pip install ...` workflows in project docs or CI unless required to bootstrap `uv`.
- Preferred commands: `uv sync`, `uv add`, `uv remove`, `uv run ...`.

## 1) Latest Dependencies Only
- Always use current stable package versions when adding or upgrading dependencies.
- Do not intentionally pin to older package versions for compatibility.
- When touching dependency manifests, upgrade related packages rather than preserving legacy ranges.

## 2) No Backward Compatibility Requirement (Pre-Release)
- This project is under active development and does not require backward compatibility.
- Breaking API/schema changes are allowed when they simplify architecture or speed delivery.
- Prefer removing transitional compatibility layers instead of maintaining legacy behavior.

## 3) TDD Is Required
- Follow test-driven development for backend work:
  1. Write/adjust failing tests first.
  2. Implement minimal code to pass tests.
  3. Refactor while keeping tests green.
- No feature is complete without automated tests that cover expected behavior and key failure modes.

## 4) Frontend Package Manager
- Use `npm` for the `apps/app` frontend (not uv, not bun).
- Run frontend commands from `apps/app/`: `npm run dev`, `npm run build`.

## 5) Frontend Component Rules
- Use shadcn components from `apps/app/components/ui/` as primitives.
- Apply Apple design language: system font stack, `#F5F5F7` bg, `#0071E3` blue, `#1D1D1F` text.
- Mark all uncertain product decisions inline with a `?` indicator.
- All async operations (generate, score, export) must show a job-running state.

## 6) No Dark Mode (MVP)
- Dark mode is out of scope for MVP. Do not implement `.dark` theme variants.

## 7) No Fallback Routes
- No fallback routes. Expose issues so we can fix them.
- Do not hide integration or runtime errors behind silent/default route behavior.
- Return explicit failure responses with actionable error details.

## 8) Official Documentation First (Planning)
- When making plans, implementation decisions, or technical recommendations, check official documentation first.
- Prefer primary sources (official docs/specs/repos) over memory or third-party summaries.
- If documentation is missing or ambiguous, call it out explicitly and list assumptions.
